Description of PAK format:
--------------------------

All numeric information is stored as big-endian. All strings will be stored as 
unicode strings.

A PAK file is made of two different sections:

	Header section
	Body section

HEADER SECTION:
---------------

Collection of entries with the following format:

Offset	Length	Data
------------------------------
0		8		Offset of data in bytes, from beginning of body section.
8		8		Compressed size in bytes.
16		8		Uncompressed size in bytes.
24      8       EntryName length.
32		NN      EntryName (Unicode).

The collection of entries ends when a -1 value is found in the offset value. The next byte 
would be the body of the file.

BODY SECTION:
-------------

Collection of compressed data for each file in the header.
